15_ClusterAnalysis

📌 Module Overview
This module focuses on Cluster Analysis, an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points without predefined labels. Clustering helps uncover hidden patterns and natural groupings in data.

🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Unsupervised learning
- Clustering vs classification
- Distance-based learning
- Cluster centroids
- Intra-cluster and inter-cluster distance
- Optimal number of clusters

📊 Topics Included
- Introduction to clustering
- K-Means clustering
- Elbow method
- Data scaling for clustering
- Cluster visualization
- Interpretation of cluster results

⚙️ Workflow Followed
1. Import required libraries
2. Load and explore the dataset
3. Preprocess and scale data
4. Determine optimal number of clusters
5. Apply clustering algorithm
6. Assign cluster labels
7. Visualize clusters

📈 Evaluation Techniques Used
- Elbow method
- Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)
- Visual inspection of cluster separation  
Note: Clustering does not use accuracy-based metrics.
