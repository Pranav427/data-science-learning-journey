# 08_Logistic_Regression

## 📌 Module Overview
This module focuses on **Logistic Regression**, a fundamental **classification algorithm** used to predict categorical outcomes (Yes/No, 0/1, True/False).  
Unlike Linear Regression, Logistic Regression estimates **probabilities** using the **Sigmoid function**.

## ⚙️ Workflow Followed

1. Import required libraries  
2. Load and explore the dataset  
3. Perform data preprocessing  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Train Logistic Regression model  
6. Make predictions  
7. Evaluate model performance

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics Used

- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC Curve & AUC**

These metrics help understand not just *how accurate* the model is, but *how well it classifies each class*.
