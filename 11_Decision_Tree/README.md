# 11_Decision_Tree

## 📌 Module Overview
This module focuses on **Decision Tree**, a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both **classification and regression**. Decision Trees split data into branches based on feature conditions, making them easy to understand and interpret.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Decision Tree structure (Root, Nodes, Leaves)  
- Splitting criteria  
- Information Gain  
- Gini Index  
- Entropy  

---

## 📊 Topics Included
- How decision trees make decisions  
- Recursive data splitting  
- Overfitting in decision trees  
- Tree depth and pruning concepts  

---
