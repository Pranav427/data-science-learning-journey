# 📘 Basic Statistics – I

## 📌 Overview
This module focuses on applying **descriptive statistical techniques** to understand and summarize a real-world sales dataset.  
Using Python libraries, the notebook explores data structure, central tendency, dispersion, and distribution patterns through both numerical summaries and visualizations.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Dataset loading and inspection  
- Data preview using `head()`  
- Dataset structure and data types using `info()`  
- Descriptive statistics using `describe()`  
- Measures of central tendency:
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode  
- Measures of dispersion:
  - Minimum and maximum values
  - Standard deviation  
- Distribution analysis using histograms  
- Outlier detection using boxplots
